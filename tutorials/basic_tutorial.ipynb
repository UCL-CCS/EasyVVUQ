    "This tutorial shows a simple EasyVVUQ workflow in action. The example used here is a simulation of a vertical deflection of a tube. The model is that of a round metal tube suspended on each end and force being applied at a certain point along it's length. The model measures how large is the deflection at the point force is applied. Full description of it can be found [here](https://openturns.github.io/openturns/latest/usecases/use_case_deflection_tube.html). This model was chosen since it is intuitively easy to understand even without any background in the relative field. It is also easy to interpret the results. We will use EasyVVUQ to determine the influence each of the input parameters has on the vertical deflection at point ```a```."

    "Next step is to specify how the input files for the simulation are to be created and how EasyVVUQ is to parse the output of the simulation. This is the job of the Encoder and Decoder classes. Our simulation takes a very simple JSON file as input. So we can just use the GenericEncoder which is a template based encoder. It will replace all keys in the template file with respective values. In this case they are identified by the ```$``` that precedes them. Alternatively, there are more complex encoders based on, for example, the [Jinja2](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.encoders.html#module-easyvvuq.encoders.jinja_encoder) templating language. Encoders can also do more complicated things, such as prepare a [directory structure](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.encoders.html#module-easyvvuq.encoders.directory_builder) if your simulation requires such. If it requires several input files you can use a [multiencoder](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.encoders.html#module-easyvvuq.encoders.multiencoder) to combine several encoders, each of which responsible for a single input file. They can also be used to [copy](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.encoders.html#module-easyvvuq.encoders.copy_encoder) files over to the run directory.\n",

We use the [JSONDecoder](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.decoders.html#module-easyvvuq.decoders.json) to extract the needed value. There also exist ready made decoders for [YAML](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.decoders.html#module-easyvvuq.decoders.yaml) and [CSV](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/easyvvuq.decoders.html#module-easyvvuq.decoders.simple_csv).
