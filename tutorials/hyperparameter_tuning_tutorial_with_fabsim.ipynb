This is the famous MNIST data set, of which 4 input features (of size 28 x 28) are show below. These are fed into a standard feed-forward neural network, which will predict the label 0-9.\n",

    "* `fab.run_uq_ensemble`: this command submits the ensemble to the (remote) host for execution. Under the hood it uses the FabSim3 `campaign2ensemble` subroutine to copy the run directories from `WORK_DIR` to the FabSim3 `SWEEP` directory, located in `config_files/grid_search/SWEEP`. From there the ensemble will be sent to the (remote) host.\n",

Returns a boolean flag. `fab.verify` will also call the FabSim `fetch_results` method, which actually retreives the results from the (remote) host. So, if you want to just get the results without verifying the presence of output files, call `fab.fetch_results(machine=MACHINE)` instead.

    "If `all_good == False` something went wrong on the (remote) host, and `sys.exit()` is called in our example, giving you the opportunity of investigating what went wrong. It can happen that a (small) number of jobs did not get executed on the remote host for some reason, whereas (most) jobs did execute succesfully. In this case simply resubmitting the failed jobs could be an option:\n",

    "fab.resubmit_previous_ensemble(CONFIG, 'grid_search')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command removes all succesful run directories from the `SWEEP` dir for which the output file `TARGET_FILENAME` has been found. For this to work, `fab.verify` must have been called. Then, `fab.resubmit_previous_ensemble` simply resubmits the runs that are present in the `SWEEP` directory, which by now only contains the failed runs. After the jobs have finished, call `fab.verify` again to see if now `TARGET_FILENAME` is present in the results directory, for every run in the `SWEEP` dir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are sure we have all required output files, the role of FabSim is over, and we proceed with decoding the output files. In this case, our Python script wrote the training and test accuracy to a CSV file, hence we use the `SimpleCSV` decoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: It is also possible to use a more flexible HDF5 format, by using `uq.decoders.HDF5` instead."
