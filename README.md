[![Binder]EasyVVUQ aims to facilitate verification, validation and 
uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for a wide variety of
simulations. While very convenient for simple cases, EasyVVUQ is particularly well suited in situations where the simulations are computationally expensive, 
heterogeneous computing resources are necessary, the sampling space is very large or book-keeping is prohibitively
complex. It coordinates execution using an efficient database, it is fault tolerant and all progress can be saved.

Here are some examples of questions EasyVVUQ can answer about your code:

 * Given the uncertainties in input parameters, what is the distribution of the output?
 * What percentage of the output variance each input parameter contributes?

It also lets you construct surrogate models that are cheaper to evaluate than the complete simulation.

The high-level overview of the library is available at our [readthedocs](https://easyvvuq.readthedocs.io/en/dev/).

## Getting Started
For a quick start with EasyVVUQ we recommend checking our basic interactive tutorial available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ/a6852d6c5ba36f15579e601d7a8d074505f31084?filepath=tutorials%2Fbasic_tutorial.ipynb).


## Functionality

Available analysis and sampling methods:

* Polynomial Chaos Expansion
* Stochastic Collocation
* Dimension-adaptive Stochastic Collocation for high-dimensional inputs
* Simplex Stochastic Collocation for irregular outputs
* Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis
* Markov-Chain Monte Carlo

EasyVVUQ also supports building surrogate models using:

* Polynomial Chaos Expansion
* Stochastic Collocation
* Gaussian Processes

Supported computing resources:

* Traditional clusters
* Kubernetes clusters

The easiest way to get familiar with the provided functionality is to follow the tutorials (*\*.ipynb* files) in our
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ/dev?filepath=tutorials).

## Installation instructions

### Requirements

To use the library you will need Python 3.7+.

### Installation using pip

If you are unsure of the version of python your default `pip` works for type:
```
pip --version
```

If the output ends with `(python 2.7)` you should replace `pip` with `pip3` in the following commands.

The following should fully install the library:
```
pip install easyvvuq
```

To upgrade the library use:

```
pip install easyvvuq --upgrade
```

### Manual installation from repository

Alternatively, you can manually install EasyVVUQ.
First clone the repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ.git
```

Note: As above, you need to be sure you are installing for Python 3 - if necessary replace `pip` with `pip3` and `python` with `python3` in the commands below.

We are trying to keep dependencies at a minimum but a few are inevitable, to install them use:
```
cd EasyVVUQ/

pip install --use-feature=2020-resolver -r requirements.txt
```

Then the library can be installed using:
```buildoutcfg
python setup.py install
```

## API

You can find the EasyVVUQ API documentation on our [GitHub Pages](https://ucl-ccs.github.io/EasyVVUQ/).
